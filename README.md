## About me

I am Rubén López, a Data Scientist and ex-CEO of [eKuore: mobile health devices](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ekuoremedic/).

This is my portfolio of the personal projects that I develop for myself as a hobby out of work.


## What I have been doing in the past

You can find a better resume about my background at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lopezperezruben/) profile, but in summary, I have been the CEO of [eKuore](https://www.ekuore.com/) for the last 12 years.

In eKuore we developed medical devices connected to the smartphone, and we used the data collected by them to train AI-backed solutions to give doctors and patients prediagnosis on pulmonary diseases such as IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) or COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease).

I led the company since its foundation, passing stages such as product development and product-market-fit search, regulatory approvals, go-to-market, funding and growth going from 4 founders to +30 employees, reaching sales in +40 countries for several millions of euros and working for top companies such as the pharmaceutical Boehringer Ingelheim.


## What I am doing now

Currently, I work as a Data Scientist for Big Decisions (part of [Anteriad](https://anteriad.com/) as its data branch), where we develop data science solutions in the field of NLP applied to telemarketing to improve the efficiency of our customer's campaigns.

We develop machine learning models to analyse call transcriptions using LLMs and traditional ML techniques, and we apply these models to solve problems such as:

- Prediction of the propensity of customers based on the calls.
- Sentiment analysis of the customers based on the language.
- Sales funnel prioritisation.
- Matching of customers/sellers based on the personality of both of them.


## Languages and tools

As a Data Scientist, I am proficient in Python, and domain maths and statistics applied to this field.

I work daily with all the data science-related Python packages/libraries such as:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- SciPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Pytorch
- BeautifulSoup
- Selenium
- Requests
- Flask
- Reflex

I have a full understanding and experience working with complex machine learning models used in the field of pneumology to make prediagnosis of diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis or COPD, in the projects developed by my company whose code I cannot share in this portfolio due to confidentiality.

I also have experience deploying projects to the public (data science-related or not), ranging from web to mobile apps, and controlling the project's life cycle.


## About this portfolio

As most of my job as a Data Scientist cannot be shown due to confidentiality, I am developing this portfolio with new projects that can help to show what I know in this field.

Along the time, I have a full history of personal projects that I have developed for myself as a hobby and that I thought could conform to a good presentation letter for myself once recapitulated, ordered and published.

So my next step is (work in progress now) to progressively release all of them in this portfolio as real usable projects that people can deploy and test.
