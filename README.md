### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


## About me

I am RubÃ©n LÃ³pez, Data Scientist and ex-CEO of [eKuore: mobile health devices](https://www.ekuore.com/).

This is my portfolio for the personal projects that I develop for myself as a hobby out of work.


## What I have been doing in the past

You can check my background at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lopezperezruben/) profile.

I have been the CEO of [eKuore](https://www.ekuore.com/) for the last 12 years. In eKuore we developed medical devices connected with the smartphone, and we used the data collected by them to train AI-backed solutions to give doctors and patients prediagnosis on pulmonary diseases such as IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) or COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease).

I led the company since the foundation, passing for stages such as the product development and product-market fit search, regulatory approvals, go-to-market, funding and growth.

## My current goals

My adventure at eKuore has finished recently, so now I am looking to come back to a technical position in the field of data science.

Most of my experience has been developed in the health industry, where I have a strong background. But I am open to opportunities in new sectors.
