## About me

I am Rubén López, a Data Scientist and ex-CEO of [eKuore: mobile health devices](https://www.ekuore.com/).

This is my portfolio of the personal projects that I develop for myself as a hobby out of work.



## What I have been doing in the past

You can find a better resume about my background at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lopezperezruben/) profile, but in summary, I have been the CEO of [eKuore](https://www.ekuore.com/) for the last 12 years.

In eKuore we developed medical devices connected to the smartphone, and we used the data collected by them to train AI-backed solutions to give doctors and patients prediagnosis on pulmonary diseases such as IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) or COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease).

I led the company since its foundation, passing stages such as product development and product-market fit search, regulatory approvals, go-to-market, funding and growth, going from 4 founders to +30 employees, reaching sales in +40 countries for several millions of euros and working for top companies such as the pharmaceutical Boehringer Ingelheim.



## Languages and tools

As a Data Scientist, I am proficient in Python, and domain maths and statistics applied to this field.

I work daily with all the data science-related Python packages/libraries such as:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- SciPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Pytorch
- BeautifulSoup
- Selenium
- Requests
- Flask
- Reflex

I have a full understanding and experience working with complex machine learning models used in the field of pneumology to make prediagnosis of diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis or COPD, in the projects developed by my company whose code I cannot share in this portfolio due to confidentiality.

I also have experience deploying projects to the public (data science-related or not), ranging from web to mobile apps, controling the full cycle of the project's life. Specifically, in the [rety.pe](https://github.com/lopezrbn/retype) project I deployed a web app for a browser game where I took charge of:

- Development of the web app as UI
   - Front and back-end developed using [Reflex](https://reflex.dev/), a new technology that allows building web apps in pure Python.
   - Development of the full control logic of the game using Python.
- Deployment of the web page via self-hosting in a VPS
   - Configuration of the server with a stack using Linux (Ubuntu 23.10), Nginx, MySQL and Python.
   - Configuration of Nginx as a web server using reverse proxy and WebSocket to communicate front with back-end.
   - Configuration of Reflex as a system service to run indefinitely as a background process.
- Creation of a database using MySQL
   - Creation of the database, designing structure, tables, columns and data types.
   - Hosting of the database in the VPS.
   - Configuration of the communication between the database and web app using MySQLConnector/Python.
   - Design of all the SQL queries needed to serve the data to the web app.
- Use of an open-source dictionary API to check the introduced words
   - Credits to [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/)



## My current goals

My adventure at eKuore has finished recently, so now I am looking to come back to a technical position in the field of data science.

Most of my experience has been developed in the health industry, and I have a strong background there as a result, but I am open to opportunities in new sectors.


## What I am working on now

As most of my job as a Data Scientist cannot be shown due to confidentiality, I am developing this portfolio with new projects that can help to show what I know in this field.

Along the time, I have a full history of personal projects that I have developed for myself as a hobby and that I thought could conform to a good presentation letter for myself once recopilated, ordered and published.

I have started with [rety.pe](https://github.com/lopezrbn/retype) project as the foundation stone for this portfolio and as the basic structure for deployment (a web app) that I will replicate for most of the other projects that are still only Jupyter notebooks.

So my next step is (work in progress now) to progressively release all of them as real usable projects that people can test in a web app, instead of a bunch of Jupyter notebooks that nobody knows how to run or demonstrate whether they work or not.
